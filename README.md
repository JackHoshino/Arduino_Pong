# Arduino_Pong
Pong game written for Arduino UNO with 2.4" TFT touchscreen LCD. 

The player is on the bottom and the user is on the top. 

Just drag your stylus along any part of the screen to place your paddle. Could certainly be improved, but was a Sunday project.

Note: You may have to modify the pins for your particular TFT module.
